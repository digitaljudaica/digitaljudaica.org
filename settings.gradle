// TODO is there a way to affect pluginArtifactId as seen by publishPlugin[JavaDocs]Jar
// tasks if it is *not* the project name?
//
// Of course, if there is, I'll need to declare the substitution when including this build,
// since the nam of the published artifact will be different from the project name:
//   {
//     dependencySubstitution {
//       substitute module('org.podval.docbook:org.podval.docbook-gradle-plugin') with project(':plugin')
//     }
//   }
rootProject.name = 'org.podval.docbook-gradle-plugin'
