This is where we are going to build a dynamic version of the www.alter-rebbe.org site.

Main reasons for the need to go dynamic (as opposed to static, Jekyll-generated) site are:
- search functionality;
- ability to modify the site.

Those are *not* the first we are going to build, thought :) 

For full dynamization of the site we also need:
- Google Cloud Storage client;
- SCSS compiler (compass/jsass?);
- MarkDown parser: flexmark-java or Laika (planet42.github.io/Laika).
