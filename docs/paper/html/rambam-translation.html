This is what the sages said:
                        "The Holy One, blessed be He, showed to Moshe, in a prophetic vision, the image of the Moon, and said to him:
                        '[When] you see [the Moon] like this - sanctify [it].'"<a href="#ftn.d0e1291" class="footnote" name="d0e1291"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>

               <p>By how much is the solar year longer than the lunar year? By approximately 11 days. Therefore, when this excess
                        accumulates to around 30 days, or a little less, or a little more, a month is added and the year is made to have
                        13 months - which is called a "pregnant" year. [This is done] because it is impossible to have a year of 12 months
                        and some days, as it is said: "for the months of the year" - you count the months of the year, but not the days of
                        the year.

               <p>Each month, the moon becomes hidden for about two days, or a little less or more: about one day before its
                        conjunction with the sun at the end of the month, and about one day after its conjunction with the sun, and in the
                        evening it is sightet in the west. The night when it is sighted in the west after being hidden is the beginning of
                        the month. We count 29 days from that day; if the moon is sighted on the 30th night, the 30th day is the first day
                        of the [next] month. If it is not sighted, first day of the [next] month is the 31st day, and the 30th day belongs
                        to the previous month. On the 31st night, we do not depend on the moon, regardless if it is visible or not, since
                        lunar month is never longer than 30 days.

               <p>Month of 29 days, [when] the moon was sighted on the 30th night, is called "lacking". If the moon was not

                        The moon sighted on the 30th night is called "moon sighted on time". If it is sighted on the 31st night, but
                        not on the 30th night, it is called "moon sighted on the night of pregnancy".

                        establishes the day as the beginning of the [new] month does it become the beginning of the [new] month.
                        As it is said: "this month shall be for you" - this testimony is entrusted to you.

               <p>The court calculates, like the astronomers who know positions of the planets and their movements,
                        and look into it until they know if it is possible for the moon to be sighted on time - that is, on the 30th
                        night - or not. If they determined that it is possible for it to be sighted, they sit and wait for withnesses
                        all day - that is, the 30th day. If the witnesses did come and were examined in accordance with the law, and
                        their words were accepted - they sanctify it. If the moon was not sighted and the witnesses did not come,
                        they complete the 30 days and the month will be "pregnant". If they found out from calculations that it is
                        impossible to sight the moon, they do not sit during the 30th day and do not await the witnesses.
                        And if the witnesses did come, it is certain that they are false witnesses or that they saw a likeness of the
                        moon in the clouds and not the real moon.

               <p>Calculation and establishment of the months and declaration of "pregnant" years is done only in the

                        But, if there was a man great in wisdom, and ordained in the Land of Israel, who came out of the Land, and
                        there remains no one equal to him in the Land of Israel, he can calculate and establish month, and declares
                        "pregnant" years outside of the Land. If he becomes aware that in the Land of Israel there appeared a man as great
                        as him - or, needless to say, greater than him - he is prohibited to establish and to proclaim outside of the Land,
                        and if he transgressed and did establish or did proclaim, it is as if he didn't do a thing.

               <p>The mean rate of movement of the sun in 1 day (that is, 24 hours) is 59&#8242;8&#8243;.
                        It follows that its movement in 10 days is 9&deg;51&#8242;23&#8243;.
                        It also follows that its movement in 100 days is 98&deg;33&#8242;53&#8243;.
                        It also follows that remainder of its movement in 1000 days, after you subtract all [multiples of] 360&deg;
                        (as was explained) is 265&deg;38&#8242;50&#8243;.
                        It also follows that the remainder of its movement in 10000 days is 136&deg;28&#8242;20&#8243;.
                      
               </p>
               <p>And in this way you can multiply and calculate its movement for any number [of days] that you want.
                        Similarly, if you want to make known to you values of its movement for 2 days, 3, 4 and so on to 10 - do it.
                        Similarly, if you want for to have known and ready values of its movement for 20 days, 30, 40 and so on to 100 - do
                  it.
                        This is clear and known once you know its movement in 1 day.
               </p>
               <p>And you should have ready and known to you mean movement of the Sun for 29 days and for 354
                        (which is the number of days in the lunar year when its months are "regular" (TODO link), and it
                        is called "regular year"). The reason is: if you have those movement values ready, this calculations of the
                        visibility of the moon will be easy, because there are 29 complete days from the night of observation to
                        the night of observation of the following month, and so it is every month: no less than 29 days and no more.
                        Since our sole desire in all those calculations is exclusively to determine visibility [of the moon].
                        And between the night of sighting of this month and night of sighting of the same month next year there is either
                        a regular year or a year and 1 day; and the same every year.
                        Mean movement of the Sun in 29 days is 28&deg;35&#8242;1&#8243;. Its movement in a regular year is 348&deg;55&#8242;15&#8243;.

                        Position of the Sun in its mean movement at the epoch was 7&deg;3&#8242;32&#8243; in the constellation of Ram (Tele).

                        for these calculations, mean lunar longitude was 1&deg;14&#8242;43&#8243; into the constellation of Ram.
                        And mean lunar anomaly on the epoch was 84&deg;28&#8242;42&#8243;.

                        We already stipulated that all the calculations in these chapters are for one purpose only:
                        to know if the moon is visible. And it is not possible for this double distance during the night of
                        observation when the moon is indeed visible to be outside of the interval from 5&deg; to 62&deg;.
                        It cannot be more - nor less.

                        mean lunar longitude the observation time. And if corrected lunar anomaly is
                        more than 180&deg; but less than 360&deg;, add visible anomaly of this corrected anomaly
                        to the mean lunar longitude the observation time. And mean lunar longitude after
