               <p>The months of the year are lunar months, as it is said: "[...] the burnt offering of the month in its month" <a href="#ftn.d0e705" class="footnote" name="d0e705"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> and it is said: "This month shall be for you the head of the months" <a href="#ftn.d0e709" class="footnote" name="d0e709"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>. This is what the sages said:
                        "The Holy One, blessed be He, showed to Moshe, in a prophetic vision, the image of the Moon, and said to him:
                        '[When] you see [the Moon] like this - sanctify [it].'"<a href="#ftn.d0e713" class="footnote" name="d0e713"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>

               <p>By how much is the solar year longer than the lunar year? By approximately 11 days. Therefore, when this excess
                        accumulates to around 30 days, or a little less, or a little more, a month is added and the year is made to have
                        13 months - which is called a "pregnant" year. [This is done] because it is impossible to have a year of 12 months
                        and some days, as it is said: "for the months of the year" - you count the months of the year, but not the days of
                        the year.

               <p>Each month, the moon becomes hidden for about two days, or a little less or more: about one day before its
                        conjunction with the sun at the end of the month, and about one day after its conjunction with the sun, and in the
                        evening it is sightet in the west. The night when it is sighted in the west after being hidden is the beginning of
                        the month. We count 29 days from that day; if the moon is sighted on the 30th night, the 30th day is the first day
                        of the [next] month. If it is not sighted, first day of the [next] month is the 31st day, and the 30th day belongs
                        to the previous month. On the 31st night, we do not depend on the moon, regardless if it is visible or not, since
                        lunar month is never longer than 30 days.

               <p>Month of 29 days, [when] the moon was sighted on the 30th night, is called "lacking". If the moon was not
                        sighted, and the previous month has 30 days, it is called "pregnant" month, or "full" month.
                        The moon sighted on the 30th night is called "moon sighted on time". If it is sighted on the 31st night, but
                        not on the 30th night, it is called "moon sighted on the night of pregnancy".

                        counts 6 days and observes Shabbos on the 7th, but is given to the court. Only when the court sanctifies and
                        establishes the day as the beginning of the [new] month does it become the beginning of the [new] month.
                        As it is said: "this month shall be for you" - this testimony is entrusted to you.

               <p>The court calculates, like the astronomers who know positions of the planets and their movements,
                        and look into it until they know if it is possible for the moon to be sighted on time - that is, on the 30th
                        night - or not. If they determined that it is possible for it to be sighted, they sit and wait for withnesses
                        all day - that is, the 30th day. If the witnesses did come and were examined in accordance with the law, and
                        their words were accepted - they sanctify it. If the moon was not sighted and the witnesses did not come,
                        they complete the 30 days and the month will be "pregnant". If they found out from calculations that it is
                        impossible to sight the moon, they do not sit during the 30th day and do not await the witnesses.
                        And if the witnesses did come, it is certain that they are false witnesses or that they saw a likeness of the
                        moon in the clouds and not the real moon.

                        But, if there was a man great in wisdom, and ordained in the Land of Israel, who came out of the Land, and
                        there remains no one equal to him in the Land of Israel, he can calculate and establish month, and declares
                        "pregnant" years outside of the Land. If he becomes aware that in the Land of Israel there appeared a man as great
                        as him - or, needless to say, greater than him - he is prohibited to establish and to proclaim outside of the Land,
                        and if he transgressed and did establish or did proclaim, it is as if he didn't do a thing.

               <p>The mean rate of movement of the sun in one day (that is, twenty four hours) is fifty nine minutes and eight seconds, in symbols
                  - 59&#8242;8&#8243;.
                        It follows that its movement in ten days is nine degrees fifty one minutes and twenty three seconds, in symbols - 9&deg;51&#8242;23&#8243;.
                        It also follows that its movement in a hundred days is ninety eight degrees thirty three minutes and fidty three seconds,
                  in symbols - 98&deg;33&#8242;53&#8243;.
                        It also follows that remainder of its movement in a thousand days, after you subtract all [multiples of] 360&deg;
                        (as was explained) is two hundred sixty five degrees thirty eight minutes and fifty seconds, in symbols - 265&deg;38&#8242;50&#8243;.
                        It also follows that the remainder of its movement in ten thousand days is one hundred thirty six degrees twenty eight
                  minutes and twenty seconds, in symbols - 136&deg;28&#8242;20&#8243;.
                      
               </p>
               <p>And in this way you can multiply and calculate its movement for any number [of days] that you want.
                        Similarly, if you want to make known to you values of its movement for two days, three, four and so on to ten - do it.
                        Similarly, if you want for to have known and ready values of its movement for twenty days, thirty, fourty and so on
                  to a hundred - do it.
                        This is clear and known once you know its movement in 1 day.
               </p>
               <p>And you should have ready and known to you mean movement of the Sun for twenty nine days and for three hundred and fifty four
                        (which is the number of days in the lunar year when its months are "regular" (TODO link), and it
                        is called "regular year"). The reason is: if you have those movement values ready, this calculations of the
                        visibility of the moon will be easy, because there are twenty nine complete days from the night of observation to
                        the night of observation of the following month, and so it is every month: no less than twenty nine days and no more.
                        Since our sole desire in all those calculations is exclusively to determine visibility [of the moon].
                        And between the night of sighting of this month and night of sighting of the same month next year there is either
                        a regular year or a year and 1 day; and the same every year.
                        Mean movement of the Sun in twenty nine days is twenty eight degrees thirty five minutes and one second, in symbols
                  - 28&deg;35&#8242;1&#8243;.
                        Its movement in a regular year is three hundred forty eight degrees, fifty five minutes and fifteen seconds, in symbols

               <p>There is a point on the Sun's orbit (and on orbits of the other seven planets) such that when the planet is there
                        it is highest above Earth. This point of the Sun's orbit (and so for other planets,
                        except for the moon) rotates with constant speed. Its movement every seventy years is approximately one degree.
                        This point is called <a class="glossterm" href="glossary.html#gva-hashemesh"><em class="glossterm"><a class="glossterm" href="glossary.html#gva-hashemesh" title="Sun's apogee">Sun's apogee</a></em></a>.
                        Its movement in ten days is one and a half seconds, half a second being thirty thirds.
                        It follows that its movement in a hundred days is fifteen seconds.
                        Its movement in a thousand days is two minutes and thirty seconds.
                        Its movement in ten thousand days is twenty five minutes.
                        It also follows that its movement in twenty nine days is a bit more (TODO!) than four seconds; and its movement in a
                  regular year is fifty three seconds.
                      
               </p>
               <p>We already said that the epoch that our calculations start from is beginning of the
                        night of the fifth day that is 3rd of Nisan of the year four thousand nine hundred thirty eight from the Creation.
                        Position of the Sun in its mean movement at the epoch was seven degrees three minutes and thirty two seconds in the
                  constellation of Ram (Tele), in symbols - 7&deg;3&#8242;32&#8243;.
                        Position of the Sun's apogee at the epoch was twenty six degrees fourty five minutes and eight seconds in the constellation
                  of Twins, in symbols - 26&deg;45&#8242;8&#8243;.
                      
               </p>
               <p>When you want to know position of the Sun in its mean movement at any time you want, take the number of days from the epoch
                  to the day that you want,
                        and find out its mean movement during those days from the values we mentioned, add all of it to the epoch, adding each
                  kind [of unit] with its kind, and
                        the result is the position of the Sun in its mean movement on that day.
                      
               </p>
               <p>For example, if we wanted to know Sun's mean position at the beginning of the night of Shabbat whose day is the fourteenth
                  of Tammuz of this year,
                        which is the year of the epoch - we find the number of days from the day of the epoch to the beginning of the day that
                  we want to find Sun's position on
                        to be a hundred days. We take its mean movement over a hundred days - which is 98&deg;33&#8242;53&#8243; - and add it to the epoch -
                  which is 7&deg;3&#8242;32&#8243;.
                        Result of this calculation: one hundred and five degrees thrity seven minutes and twenty five seconds. In symbols -
                  105&deg;37&#8242;25&#8243;.
                        So its position in its mean movement at the beginning of this night is in the constellation of Cancer, at fifteen degrees
                  in it, and thirty seven minutes of
                        the sixteenth degree.
               </p>
               <p>Mean position thus calculated is sometimes exactly at the beginning of the night, sometimes an hour before sunset, and sometimes
                  - an hour after sunset.
                        This fact is not important for the Sun in the calculations of the observation [of the new Moon] since we compensate
                  for this approximation when calculating
                        mean Moon.
               </p>
               <p>Do it the same way for whatever time you want whatsoever, even after a thousand years: when you add up all the reminders and
                  add to the epoch, result you
                      get is the the mean position. And the same you do for the mean Moon and mean of every planet: once you know what is the
                  movement in one day and what is the
                      epoch that we start from, and you sum up its movement in the years and days that you want, and add it to the epoch - you
                  get its position in mean movement.
               </p>
               <p>Do the same for the Sun's apogee: add its movement in those days or years to the epoch, and you get position of the Sun's
                  apogee for the day that you want.
               </p>
               <p>Also, if you want to make a different epoch from which to start, other that the epoch that we start from (which is this year),
                  so that epoch is at the
                       beginning of the year of a known cycle or at the beginning of a hundred-year period - you can do it. And if yuo want
                  the epoch from which you start to be
                      in the years that already passed before this epoch or many years after it - the way is known.
               </p>
               <p>What is this way? You already know movement of the Sun in an regular year, and its movement in twenty nine days, and its movement
                  in one day.
                      And it is known that year whose months are full is longer than the regular year by one day,
                      and the year whose months are lacking is shorter than the regular year by one day.
                      And the leap year: if its months are regular, it will be longer than the regular year by thirty days,
                      and if its months are full, it will be longer than the regular one by thirty one day,
                      and if its months are lacking, it will be longer than the regular one by twenty nine days.
                      Once you know all those facts, calculate Sun's mean movement for the years and days that you want, and add to the epoch
                  that we made,
                      and you'll get its mean position for the day that you want from the coming years - and that you make into an epoch.
                      Or subtract mean [movement] that you calculated form the epoch that we made, and you get an epoch for the day that you
                  want from the years that passed,
                      and make that mean [position] an epoch.
                      And the same you shall do for the mean Moon and the rest of the planets if [their movements] will be known to you.
                      And it should be clear to you from the idea of our words that the same way you can find out mean Sun for any day you want
                  from the coming days,
                      you can calculate its mean for any day you want from the days that passed.

                        the way we explained, and calculate position of the Sun's apogee. Subtract position of the Sun's apogee from the Sun's
                  mean position;
                        what is left is called <em class="glossterm">maslul of the Sun</em>.

                        To find true lunar longitude (&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1495; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) on a specific day:
                        First, calculate mean lunar longitude during observation time of the desired night.
                        Also, calculate mean lunar anomaly and mean solar longitude for the same time.
                        Then, subtract mean solar longitude from the mean lunar longitude and double the result.
                        This value is called <em class="glossterm">doubled distance</em> (&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; &#1492;&#1499;&#1508;&#1493;&#1500;).

                        to know if the moon is visible. And it is not possible for this double distance during the night of
                        observation when the moon is indeed visible to be outside of the interval from 5&deg; to 62&deg;.
                        It cannot be more - nor less.
