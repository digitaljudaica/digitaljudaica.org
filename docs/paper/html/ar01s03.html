         <p>In 1984, The Rebbe instructed the Jews to learn Rambam every day. As a result, in 1991 I encountered calendar
            chapters of Rambam, decided to reconstruct the models behind the calculations described in them, and discovered
            mistakes in the text of one of the laws (15:6). The results were published in "Notices of Temimim and Anash", a
            weekly of the central Lubavicher Yeshiva 770. Some of the readers were appalled that someone dares to correct the
                  text of Rambam! My point was that the text as published contains mistakes that need to be corrected. Indeed,
                  Frenkel edition [<a class="biblioref" href="bi01.html#Frenkel">Frenkel</a>], that was already published at the time, corrects all of the
                  mistakes I did. In fact, they were already corrected by Hazon Ish in his commentary on Rambam [[<a href="bi01.html#HazonIsh" class="biblioref">HazonIsh</a>]] - but I did not know it then.
         </p>
             
         <p>In 2005, during a visit to Israel, I discussed the subject with Rabbi Michael Koretz.</p>
             
         <p>In 2008 I acquired a pile of books on the subject and started looking into it; I also experimented with
                  various ways of publishing the work on the web.
         </p>
             
         <p>In 2009 I coded some of the algorithms to look into the rumors the dates of Birkhat HaHamah that were
                  circulating then.
         </p>
             
         <p>In 2011 I realized that the work needs to be published before it is finished - so that others could help
                  finish it ;)
