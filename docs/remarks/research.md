# Research Questions #

## Fixed Calendar ##

### Calculate Meton's cycle ###

Show why 19-years cycle is the best.
Calculate optimal distribution of the leap years.

### New moon from 6:7 ###

Rambam mentiones Nisan conjunction on Sunday, 5 hours and 107 units parts after sunrise.
He doesn't give the year, and there seems to be no such year...

### Seasons ###

Rav Ada's tkufos started a week later than Shmuel's! Isn't it readily observable?
Analyze the difference in historic periods...

### Sun Cycle ###

Where and when was the Sun created?
Compare with Rambam's epoch from the astronomical calendar.
Where and how is date of birchat hachamo defined?
How would it look according to the other opinion? 

## Astronomical Calendar ##

### Angular movement for 29 days ###

Are Rambam's values reconstructible if value for 29 days is calculated as 3*10-1, not 2*10+9?
For any tables other than SunLongitudeMean?

### Angular speeds from periods ###

Cnvert each year length mentioned in the fixed calendar to angular speed.
Angular speed of the moon = 360 / (1/tropical month + 1/solar year).
Moon.meanLunarPeriod - what is it called? Tropical?

### Distance between the mean and true new moons ###

KH 5:1-2 says that the distance is no more than a day.
Calculate this difference for all months;
Rambam's epoch - two days after molad?! (Petya Ofman).
