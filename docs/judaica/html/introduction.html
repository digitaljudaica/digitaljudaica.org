            <p>We want to have a computer environment that supports and facilitates study and
               research of Jewish Orthodox texts. (Most of the technological pieces that we need to
               develop are not at all specific to Jewish Orthodox Texts. On the other hand, desire
                               to facilitate study of such texts is our primary motivation.)
            </p>
                        
            <p>This "dream system" will record various information about the texts and support
                               doing interesting things with them.
            </p>
                        
            <p>On the text level, we want to allow marking up names of people and places, index
                               entries, logical structure of statements, user-defined tags and the like. On the
                               structural level: allow capturing of multiple structures of the same text, for
                               example - chapter/verse and pages of a printed edition. On the intra-text level:
                               record links from one text to another with their types and other metadata, and
                               support link reversal.
            </p>
                        
            <p>It should be possible to print any text with glosses formatted nicely.</p>
                        
            <p>The system should be accessible through a clean, even minimalist, but powerful
                               web-based interface. Mass participation - proofreading of the texts, marking them
                               up, clarifying the cross-references and such - should be very much supported.

            <p>Initial conversations in this area took place in 1992-1994, between Leonid
                               Dubinsky and Baruch Gorkin. Most of the requirements were understood then, but not
                               the need for universal web-availability and crowd-sourcing: access to the Internet
                               was not what it is now.
            </p>
                        
            <p>We realized that a standard approach to text markup has to be used, and settled on
                               SGML (XML did not yet exist).
            </p>
                        
            <p>In the summer of 2006, discussions restarted between Dubinsky and Gorkin.
                               Crowd-sourcing and potential commercialization were discussed. In the Fall of 2006,
                               Michoel Koritz joined in.

            <p>Some of the research notes, discussion items and conclusions related to this
                               project were captured and published on the project's web site.
            </p>
                        
            <p>Standard XML formats for text publishing were tried: DocBook and TEI. Since the
                               format that is likely to be used for the storage of the texts themselves is TEI, we
                               wanted to use TEI as the format for publishing the project papers too. This turned
                               out to be impractical, since there is no convenient way to edit TEI document over
                               the web using wiki-like interface. It seems that some people tried creating packages
                               with such functionality, but nothing is being developed now. There is the DocBook
                               Wiki, but it's approach to section editing leaves much to be desired, and anyway,
                               TEI and not DocBook is our preferred format. Also, the machinery for turning TEI
                               into PDF had some&nbsp;<a class="ulink" href="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0712&amp;L=TEI-L&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=63" target="_top">issues</a>.
            </p>
                        
            <p>We then published in a form of wiki pages - some of them in Russian. A blog was
                               deemed an appropriate format, since it captures a sense of development in time,
                               allows comments and, hopefully, encourages smaller, but more frequent publication
                               :)
            </p>
                        
            <p>As part of this project, we need to develop technology for web-based editing of
                               big texts with rich markup and complex structure. When we have it, we'll use it for
                               publishing our papers, so this is not the final format ;)
