# Table of contents of Rambam's Kiddush HaChodesh #


## General ##

### Chapter 1 ###

- 1:1 Month is lunar; year is solar.
- 1:2 Solar year is ~11 days longer than the lunar;
      when discrepancy accumulates to ~30 days, year is made leap.
- 1:3 Moon is not seen for ~1 day before and after the conjunction;
      first night when the Moon is sighted - Rosh Chodesh; next Rosh Chodesh:
      if it is sighted on the night of the 30th day - 30th; if not - 31st.      
- 1:4 Short/full month.
- 1:5-8 Court calculates in a manner _resembling_ the calculations of the astronomers.

### Chapter 2 ###

- 1-10 Court procedure.

### Chapter 3 ###

- 1-19 Court procedure; messengers.

### Chapter 4 ###

- 4:1-2 Leap year - additional Adar;
      Pesach (15th of Nisan) must in the spring: not before the day of vernal equinox
      (Sun enters Aries, see 9:3) and before the next summer solstice.
- 4:3-8 Other reasons for leaping the year;
      (Succos after the autumnal equinox - not mentioned in Rambam.)
- 4:9-17 Court procedure.       


## Arithmetic calendar ##

### Chapter 5 ###

- 5:1-2 Introduction; discrepancy with observations: -1…+1 day (+1 - very rare).
- 5:2 Fixed Rosh Hodesh: sighting of the Moon can be +/- 1 day; +2 - extremely rare.
- 5:3 When started.
- 5:4-12 Second day of festivals.
- 5:13 Conclusion.

### Chapter 6 ###

- 6:1 "Molad" - approximate conjunction (Sun. Moon and Earth on the same line).
- 6:2 day = 24 hours; 1 hour = 1080 parts.
- 6:3 Lunar month (between conjunctions) = 29d12h793p.
- 6:4 Lunar year (12 lunar months) = 354d8h876p = 354d8h48m40s;
      Leap lunar year (13 lunar months) = 383d21h589p;
      Solar year = 365d6h (see also 9:1, 10:6);
      longer than the lunar year by 10d21h204p.
- 6:5 Lunar month % 7 = 1d12h793p; lunar year % 7 = 4d8h876p; leap year % 7 = 5d21h589p.
- 6:7 if molad Nisan - Sunday, 5h107p after sunrise, next month - Iyar: Tuesday night, 5h900p.
- 6:8 First conjunction - Tishrei, year #1: Monday, 5h204p (just subtract % from the next one :))
    Conjunction of Rosh Hashono of Adam's creation (year #2, see Shmita and Yovel 10:2): Friday, 6h.
- 6:9 We do not need the number of days, just the remainders.
- 6:10 19 year cycle (12+7 leap); because the difference between 19 solar years and
      the cycle is less than a day: 1h485p.
- 6:11 Leap years: 3,6,8,11,14,17,19.
- 6:12 cycle % 7 = 2d16h595p.

### Chapter 7 ###

- 7:1 Rosh Hashono gets pushed off from Sunday, Wednesday, Friday.
- 7:2 Gets pushed off if molad is after noon (Molad Zoken).
- 7:3 ADU applies after noon push-off also.
- 7:4 Non-leap year, if molad is at night of the 3rd day after 9h204p: push off to Thursday (or the year willbe too long).
- 7:5 Year after leap one, Monday, after 5h589p: push to Tuesday.
- 7:7 ADU - why?

### Chapter 8 ###

- 8:1 -> 6.3
- 8:2 Month - 29 or 30 days.
- 8:5-6 Same?
- 8:7 TODO
- 8:8 TODO

### Chapter 9 ###

- 9:2 1/4 of the year between seasons (91d 7.5h).
- 9:3 Nisan (Spring) - Aries; Tammuz - Cancer; Tishrei - Libra; Teves - Cap.?
    Vernal equinox of year #1 = 7d9h642p before conjunction of Nisan. Notes 5,7 in Moznaim edition.
    Every year seasons move 30h; in 28 years - in the same place.
- 9:5 Vernal equinox, year 4930: midnight, 5th day, 8th of Nisan.
- 9:6-8 Simplified procedure.
- 9:7 Real seasons - 2 days before average ones.
    Note 5: 1st hour of the 4th day of creation; 1st vernal equinox.
    Autumnal: Wednesday, 3 hours after daybreak, 1d23h before conjunction of Tishrei.

### Chapter 10 ###

- 10:1 More precise length of a solar year. Moments.
- 10:2 Seasons for this year length.
- 10:3 Vernal equinox of year #1 - 9h642p before conjunction of Nisan.
       (Differenbt from 9:3: Rav Ada follows Rabbi Yehoshua - world created in Nisan;
        Shmuel (9:3) follows Rabbi Eliezer - world created in Tishrei.)
       Every first year of the 19-year cycle.
- 10:4 1/4 of the year between seasons (91d7h519p31m).
- 10:5 Simplified procedure.
- 10:6 This more precise calculation of seasons was used by Sanhedrin to leap the year because of the spring equinox.
- 10:7 Real vernal equinox approximately 2 days before either of these calculations.         


## Atronomical Calculations ##

### Chapter 11 ###

- 11:1-4 Visibility calculations are deep. Fixed calendar can be appreciated even by school children in 3 or 4 days.
- 11:5-6 Calculations are simplified/approximated to not fluster the inexprerienced; result - visibility of the moon - is not affected.
- 11:7-9 360 degrees; 60 minutes, seconds...; order of the 12 constellations.
- 11:10-12 adding/subtracting angles.
- 11:13-14 Velocities are constant. Earth encircled by all the spheres but isn't in the center. Notes 14,15 in Moznaim.
- 11:15 Mean and true motion.
- 11:16 Epoch.
- 11:17 Location: Jerusalem; see Chapter 17.

### Chapter 12 ###

- 12:1 Movement of the Sun. Moznaim Note 6: calculations may be accurate only on the first day of the month; Note 7.
