## The paper ##

Paper on Rambam's Laws of the Sanctification of the Moon:
- [HTML](/paper/html/)
- [PDF](/paper/pdf/calendar.pdf)
- [EPUB2](/paper/epub2/calendar.epub)

Goals of the paper:
- reconstruct models that Rambam uses and their parameters from the Rambam's text;
- identify misprints in the traditional editions; 
- see how Rambam's calculations of the moon visibility compare to the current models.

Desire to publishing this paper in multiple formats was part of the motivation for writing
[Gradle DocBook plugin](https://github.com/dubinsky/podval-docbook-gradle) in general and its support
for mathematics in DocBook in particular. It also influenced my thinking on
[publishing papers on the web](http://dub.podval.org/2019/05/06/publishing-papers-on-web-2.html).

Code that makes possible calculations with dates, time intervals and angles exactly as they are
described by Rambam is available: [Repository](https://github.com/opentorah/calendar).
