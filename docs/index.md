title: Digital Judaica Done Right
---

There are a few ongoing projects:
- digital edition of Rabbi Wichnin's [Chumash Questions](https://www.chumashquestions.org/) book;
- [archive documents](https://www.alter-rebbe.org) of the arrests of the Alter Rebbe in 1798 and 1800;   
- [paper](https://www.jewish-calendar.org/) on Rambam's Laws of the Sanctification of the Moon;

Ideas (dating from 1991) for the dream environment for working with Jewish texts are the
subject of two papers: general ([HTML](/judaica/html/index.html) [PDF](/judaica/pdf/judaica.pdf)
[EPUB](/judaica/epub/judaica.epub)) and typesetting-rekated ([HTML](/typesetting/html/index.html)
[PDF](/typesetting/pdf/judaica.pdf) [EPUB](/typesetting/epub/judaica.epub)).
Code implementing some of those ideas is in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/digitaljudaica/store).

[SBL font](http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx) is
 needed for viewing Tanach.
