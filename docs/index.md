title: Digital Judaica Done Right
---

There are a few ongoing projects:
- digital edition of Rabbi Wichnin's [Chumash Questions](https://www.chumashquestions.org/) book;
- [archive documents](https://www.alter-rebbe.org) of the arrests of the Alter Rebbe in 1798 and 1800;
- code that [generates](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/collector) the above website;   
- paper ([HTML](/dream/paper/html/index.html), [PDF](/dream/paper/pdf/dream.pdf),
  [EPUB](/dream/paper/epub2/dream.epub)) describing ideas (dating from 1991) for the dream environment for
   working with Jewish texts;
- companion paper ([HTML](/typesetting/paper/html/index.html), [PDF](/typesetting/paper/pdf/typesetting.pdf),
  [EPUB](/typesetting/paper/epub2/typesetting.epub)) on typesetting Jewish texts;
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/store) implementing some of those ideas and
  [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/texts) for working with specific Jewish texts;
- paper ([HTML](/calendar/paper/html/index.html), [PDF](/calendar/paper/pdf/calendar.pdf),
  [EPUB](/calendar/paper/epub2/calendar.epub)) on Rambam's Laws of the Sanctification of the Moon;
  goals of the paper:
  - reconstruct models that Rambam uses and their parameters from the Rambam's text;
  - identify misprints in the traditional editions; 
  - see how Rambam's calculations of the moon visibility compare to the current models;
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/calendar) implementing Rambam's calculations
  with dates, time intervals and angles and related algorithms;   
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/schedule) for calculating Torah reading/learning schedules;
- code re-used in multiple projects for processing [metadata](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/metadata),
  [XML](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/xml) and general
  [utilities](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/util);   
- desire to publishing this paper in multiple formats was part of the motivation for writing
  [Gradle DocBook plugin](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/docbook) in general
  and its support for [mathematics](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/fop) in DocBook in particular;
  it also influenced my thinking on
  [publishing papers on the web](http://dub.podval.org/2019/05/06/publishing-papers-on-web-2.html);
