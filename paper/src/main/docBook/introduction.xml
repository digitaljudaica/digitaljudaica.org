  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>In the "Laws of Sanctification of the Moon", Rambam (TODO: where?) gives algorithmic description of two
    calendars: fixed ("arithmetic") and observational ("astronomical"). Both calendars are described in the form ready
    to be implemented, but the reasons for the calculation steps are not always given. Especially for the astronomical
    calendar, the following questions arise: where do the numbers come from? What are the models - and the formulae
    resulting from them - that reproduce the numbers? Sometimes Rambam describes the models, so only the formulae need
    to be reconstructed; sometimes the models are not described, so both the models and the formulae need to be
    reconstructed. </para>
