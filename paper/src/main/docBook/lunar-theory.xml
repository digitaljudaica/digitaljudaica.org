                        Rambam uses ‘nimzes’ instead of ‘nimzo’ for 10000 days. Also, Rambam says
                        "'ordered' year"; it was rendered as 254 in accordance with Law 12:1.
                    </para>

                    <para> It is not clear how Rambam arrived at the values he gives. When
                        value of the movement in one day given by Rambam is multiplied by 29, 100 etc.,
                        the result is smaller than that of Rambam.

                        Rambam does not describe the model behind this correction.
                        Because the models Rambam did describe until now are the same
                        as Almagest's models
                        (including numerical parameters), and because this correction
                        is determined by the (doubled)
                        sun-moon elongation, just like Almagest's "improved" model of
                        the moon ("the crank"),
                        I assume that that model was used to calculate this correction.
                        TODO: describe the model!

                    <para>
                        It seems that Rambam treats "the crank" as just a calculation
                        device - otherwise,
                        table giving visible anomaly from the corrected anomaly should
                        take into account changes in the
                        earth-moon distance depending on the elongation - and it does not!
                        Maybe that is why he does not describe the model behind this correction.
                        And maybe this is why Rambam reiterates - in Law 2 - that only the observability of the new moon
                        needs to be calculated correctly.
