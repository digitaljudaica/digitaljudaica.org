## DocBook XSLT Issues ##

_Footnotes_ DocBook stylesheets render each footnote on a separate line; when there are many of
them, this doesn't look good. Is there a way to render footnotes as a continuous block?

_Honorifics_ DocBook stulesheets render honorifics in bibliography with dots after them,
which doesn't look good for 'Rabbi' :) It can be removed
(as in [chumashquestions.org](http://www.chumashquestions.org/)), but has then to be typed in
for all other honorifics.
 
_Edition_ In bibliography, when I give "edition" as "3rd", it is printed as "3rd", not "3rd edition".
Am I supposed to spell it out everywhere?!

_Numbers_ Numbers (degrees) seem to be printed lower than letters in the PDF output.

_Links_ Links (e.g., bibliorefs) in PDF output are clickable, but it is not obvious.
Can I persuade DocBook stylesheets to make them underlined with blue or something?

_Fonts_ Hebrew and Russian seem to work in PDF when it is generated by Oxygen, but not the plugin?
Set body and title font families to something that has glyphs for English, Cyrillic and Hebrew
(DejaVu Sans?). The fonts get embedded in the PDF document.

_Revision_ Add date of revision to the title page.

_Tables_
- force monospaced font
- force good font for the degree values (which tend to go Times or something)
- days column needs to be aligned right
- set column width?
- use more HTML-like tables?
