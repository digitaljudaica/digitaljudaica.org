6:1 "Molad" - approximate conjunction (Sun. Moon and Earth on the same line).
6:2 day = 24 hours; 1 hour = 1080 parts.
6:3 Lunar month (between conjunctions) = 29d12h793p.
6:4 Lunar year (12 lunar months) = 354d8h876p = 254d8h48m40s.
6:5 Lunar month % 7 = 1d12h793p; lunar year % 7 = 4d8h876p; leap year % 7 = 5d21h589p.
6:7 if molad Nisan - Sunday, 5h107p after sunrise, next month - Iyar: Tuesday night, 5h900p.
6:8 First conjunction - Tishrei, year #1: Monday, 5h204p (just subtract % from the next one :))
    Conjunction of Rosh Hashono of Adam's creation (year #2, see Shmita and Yovel 10:2): Friday, 6h.
6:9 We do not need the number of days, just the remainders.
6:10 19 year cycle (12+7) differs from the 19 solar years by 1h485p.
6:11 Leap years: 3,6,8,11,14,17,19.
6:12 cycle % 7 = 2d16h595p.
7:1 Rosh Hashono gets pushed off from Sunday, Wednesday, Friday.
7.2 Gets pushed off if molad is after noon (Molad Zoken).
7.3 ADU applies after noon push-off also.
7.4 Non-leap year, if molad is at night of the 3rd day after 9h204p: push off to Thursday (or the year willbe too long).
7.5 Year after leap one, Monday, after 5h589p: push to Tuesday.
7.7 ADU - why?
8:1 -> 6.3
8.2 Month - 29 or 30 days.
8.5-8.6 Same?
9.2 1/4 of the year between seasons (91d 7.5h).
9.3 Nisan (Spring) - Aries; Tammuz - Cancer; Tishrei - Libra; Teves - Cap.?
    Vernal equinox of year #1 = 7d9h642p before conjunction of Nisan. Notes 5,7 in Moznaim edition.
    Every year seasons move 30h; in 28 years - in the same place.
9.5 Vernal equinox, year 4930: midnight, 5th day, 8th of Nisan.
9.6-8 Simplified procedure.
9.7 Real seasons - 2 days before average ones.
