        <title>Using processing instructions</title>
        <para>
            Processing instructions of the form &lt;?eval EXPRESSION?&gt; used
            in the DocBook documents are replaced with the result of evaluation
            of the EXPRESSION, for example: Version <?eval version ?>.</para>
        <para>
            Processing instructions can only be used inside XML elements, not in
            attributes.</para>

        <title>Using entity substitutions</title>

        <para>
            This sample shows the use of entity substitution defined in your
            pom.xml configuration: &amp;version; = &version;. The entity substitution is
            also working within xml attributes as you can see in the following link:
            <link xlink:href="http://&version;">this is a link</link>.
        </para>
        <para>To enable this functionality, you need to add a Docbook DOCTYPE
            declaration to you top-level DocBook file, even though DocBook 5.x doesn't really have a DTD :).
            Between the XML declaration and the root element, add the following:
            &lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V5.0//EN" "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/dtd/docbook.dtd"&gt;
            If using root element other than "article", adjust DOCTYPE declaration accordingly.
